# Recordari iOS

This is the code for the Recordari iOS app, it is no longer available in the app store, and has been superseded by https://loggit.net

This was my second ever iOS project, and first Swift experience as well, so I know the structure is not great.

If there are suggestions, I'd appreciate them!
