# Recordari iOS

This is the code for the Recordari iOS app, available at https://itunes.apple.com/pt/app/recordari-unscheduled-events/id1026206599

It's open for everyone to contribute to.

This was my second ever iOS project, and first Swift experience as well, so I know the structure is not great.

If there are suggestions, I'd appreciate them!
